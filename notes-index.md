# 📝 Notes Index

This is a curated collection of my research notes, paper summaries, and insights on various topics, mostly on AI.

(minor note: These notes are in markdown and occasionally link cross repo assuming that 
these repos are sibling folders of each other. 
So if you encounter a broken link, manually adjust it to be in another repo.)
